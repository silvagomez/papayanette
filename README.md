This is designed to help, understand and ensure that the code behaves as intended and produces the expected results. Tests act as a safety net, catching potential bugs or regressions before they reach users. By identifying issues early in the development process, we can fix them promptly, leading to higher code quality.
<br><br>
> [!WARNING]⚠️
> Write your own tests, it's a very essential part of programming.
<br><br>
Currently papaya has tests for: 
* libft
* ft_printf
* get_next_line

I will continue developing papaya to be more user friendly.

## Why papaya?
In [Colombia](https://www.colombia.co/) :colombia: we have the expression **"_dar papaya_"** that means to give unnecessarily the opportunity for something to happen, to expose oneself, to risk, to be imprudent, to incur in innocence, to be careless or to give too much advantage.
<br><br>
In this sense, the goal is to avoid **"_dar papaya_"** by running a battery of tests to check the code.
