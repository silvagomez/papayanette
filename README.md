This is designed to help, understand and ensure that the code behaves as intended and produces the expected results. Tests act as a safety net, catching potential bugs or regressions before they reach users. By identifying issues early in the development process, we can fix them promptly, leading to higher code quality.
<br><br>
⚠️ Write your own tests, It's a very essential part of programming. ⚠️
Currently papaya has tests for: 
* libft
* ft_printf
* get_next_line

## Why papaya?
In [Colombia](https://www.colombia.co/) :colombia: we have the expression **"dar papaya"** that means _to give unnecessarily the opportunity for something to happen, to expose oneself, to risk, to be careless, to be imprudent, to incur in innocence, to be careless or to give too much advantage._
<br><br>
In this sense, the goal is to avoid **"dar papaya"** by running a battery of tests to check the code.
